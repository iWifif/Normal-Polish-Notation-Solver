# Normal-Polish-Notation-Solver
A program that can solve NPN notation
Take as an input an Normal Polish Notation (NPN) statement and prints the result
Example:  x + 2 3 + 2 2 (result is 20)
We compute the result by storing the info in a binary tree and computing the answer in the same tree in a recursive way.
